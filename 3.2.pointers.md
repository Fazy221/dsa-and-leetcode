Let's observe this code:

    let num1 = 9;
     let num2 = num1;
     console.log(num2); // 9

    num1 = 10;
    console.log(num2); // still 9

Reason why num2 is still 9 because at point of declaration in memory, it was still 9. There are no pointers involved when variable declared.

Now let's see obj:

    let obj1 = {
      name: "Faizan",
    };
    let obj2 = obj1;
    obj1.name = "Hassan";
    console.log(obj2);

Even though obj2 was defined before changing property of obj1, in reality it's just pointing to the address of obj1 in memory as reference. Therefore whatever value obj1 has anywhere in code, obj2 is just pointing to it.

Let's modify a bit:

    let obj1 = {
      name: "Faizan",
    };
    let obj2 = obj1;
    obj1 = {
      name: "Hassan",
    };
    console.log(obj2);

Even though this should produce same result, it doesn't bcuz we're just reassigning obj1 with new obj {name:"Hassan",} in memory not modifying original obj1 while obj2 still pointing to original obj1. JS will run garbage collector and clean reassigned obj.
