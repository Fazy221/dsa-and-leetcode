#Previous Explanation

<!--
Look at the following code:

    function addItem(n) {
      return n + n;
    }
    console.log(addItem(100));

O(1), also known as constant time complexity, means that the runtime of an algorithm remains constant, regardless of the size of the input. No matter what value n is, the function addItem will always perform a fixed number of operations which is addition in this case.

In other wording, Basically, O(1) means its computation time is constant, while O(n) means it will depend lineally on the size of input - i.e. looping through an array has O(n) - just looping -, because it depends on the number of items, while calculating the maximum between two ordinary numbers has O(1). -->

#New Explanation

1.  O(1) - Constant Time Complexity:

        function printFirstElement(array) {
            // O(1) operation: accessing the first element of the array
            console.log(array[0]);
        }

In this example, the printFirstElement function takes an array as input and prints the first element of the array. Regardless of the size of the array (n), the function always performs a single operation (accessing the first element), so its time complexity is O(1).

2.  O(n) - Linear Time Complexity:

        function printAllElements(array) {
            // O(n) operation: looping through each element in the array
            for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
                console.log(array[i]);
            }
        }

In this example, the printAllElements func takes an arr as input and prints each element of the array. The function iterates through the entire array, so the number of operations increases linearly with the size of the array (n). Therefore, its time complexity is O(n).

In summary, O(1) represents constant time complexity, where the number of operations remains constant regardless of the input size. On the other hand, O(n) represents linear time complexity, where the number of operations increases linearly with the input size.
