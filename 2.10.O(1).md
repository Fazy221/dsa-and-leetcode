Look at the following code:

    function addItem(n) {
      return n + n;
    }
    console.log(addItem(100));

O(1), also known as constant time complexity, means that the runtime of an algorithm remains constant, regardless of the size of the input. No matter what value n is, the function addItem will always perform a fixed number of operations which is addition in this case.

In other wording, Basically, O(1) means its computation time is constant, while O(n) means it will depend lineally on the size of input - i.e. looping through an array has O(n) - just looping -, because it depends on the number of items, while calculating the maximum between two ordinary numbers has O(1).
