    1. Stack is like can of tennis balls. We can only remove the one on top. It follows the LIFO terminology (Last in First out)
    2. In computing, let's say we open a tab and go to insta then youtube then fb. Now to come back to insta, we'll keep clicking back btn until we come there.
    3. In interviews, it's common to ask how it's made in arrays which is too easy. Howsoever, we'll LinkedList for it but in case off array, we've to add or remove from right end and that's why it's too easy because from top-bottom view, we can put right side on top as it's O(1) from there while left which is O(n) is kept at bottom because index is readjusted of whole array
    4. One common example of stack is callstack which we'll further learn in future
    5. For course purpose, we'll use LinkedList. Since it has left and right, it's O(1) from left on both add/remove while on right, still O(1) on add but O(n) on remove due to putting this.tail to left. That's main reason why we'll always use this.head side as top because on tail side which is always pointing to null, everytime we pop something off then whole LL will be iterated which ain't sth we want in LIFO. Now we'll see it from top to bottom view and instead of calling it this.head and this.tail, we'll simply say top and bottom. Moreover, we won't be needing bottom so we'll leave it.
