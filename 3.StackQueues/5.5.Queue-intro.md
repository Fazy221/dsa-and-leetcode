        1. With queue, it's like standing in a queue. You join a queue then wait for person first in line to get out. This follows the FIFO terminology (first in first out).
        2. In queue, we've to add from one end and remove from other end. It doesn't matter which end.
        3. Talking of data structures, if we use array then we know that whether we add or remove from left side, it's O(n) since whole array's indexes are adjusted. Now coming to Linked List, it's only O(n) when removing from right side due to this.tail needed to be put on left after iteration. Therefore, we can remove from left side instead like shift and add from right side like push.
        4. Instead of this.head and this.tail, we can call it first and last. Moreover, instead of push and shift, we'll call it enqueue and dequeue method
