Add to Linked List end:

    - Let's say we want to add 4. Select the last item of LL which is pointing to null and point it to 4. Then ask tail to point to same item as formal last item.

    - Even if there were 100 items, no. of steps to push in end would be same (constant) so it's O(1).

Remove from Linked List end:

    - Just do reverse and remove 4. Tricky part is tail; how can it point to formal node (7) now that it becomes current last item. Only pointer pointing to 7 is node left to it which is 23. We'll have to start at head and iterate through whole LL to get to pointer of 23 pointing to 7 and set tail's pointer same as 23's. As we're iterating throughout, this is O(n) as it's linear time complexity, more size == more no. of steps.

Add to Linked List start:

    - If we want to add 4 to start of list, we can have 4's pointer set same as LL head's pointer which is pointer to start item. Then we can have head point to first item of LL which is new item 4 in this case. This is O(1) because no iteration.

Remove from Linked List start:

    - Now as we want to remove first item of LL which is 4 in this case, have head point set same as pointer of 4 which is pointing to it's next value 11. Then simply drop off 4 from LL.
