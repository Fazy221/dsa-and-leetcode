There are 3 Greek letters we'll consistently see:

    Omega (Similar to god of war symbol)

    Theta (0 with strike through)

    Omicron (big O)

Now consider using a for loop to iterate over this array below:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

    If we run loop to find value 1, it'll be best cause due to least no. of iterations and thus, such case will be called Omega.

    If we run loop to find value 4, it'll be average case and thus called theta.

    Finally if we run loop to find value 7, it'll be the worse case and called omicron (big O).
