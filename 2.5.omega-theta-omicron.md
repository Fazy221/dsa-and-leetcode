There are 3 Greek letters we'll consistently see:

    Omega (Similar to god of war symbol)

    Theta (0 with strike through)

    Omicron (big O)

Now consider using a for loop to iterate over this array below:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

    If we run loop to find value 1, it'll be best cause due to no iteration done as value is found firsthand and thus, such case will be called Omega.

    If we run loop to find value 4, it'll be average case and thus called theta because iteration is still done halfaway.

    Finally if we run loop to find value 7, it'll be the worse case as iteration across whole array is done to find value and thus called omicron (big O).
