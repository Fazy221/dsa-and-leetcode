For a simple tree with no child and parent only, we've 2^1 - 1 = 1.

```js
{
  value: 51;
  left: null;
  right: null;
}
```

The reason why we're doing substraction here with 1 is because as we start appending childs, it starts to make sense as there will be 3 values in tree so result is naturally 3 with 2^2 - 1 = 3.

```js
{
  value: 51;
  left: {
    value:23;
    left:null;
    right:null;
  };
  right: {
    value:32;
    left:null;
    right:null;
  };;
}
```

As we keep expanding, it'll be expanding as well. Now if we drop 1 from calculation and focus on 2^1 part for approximate calculation, first let's say we want to find 51 which is parent, it'll be first step so 2^1. Then we want to find 32 which is child so it'll be 2 steps so 2^2. As we keep expanding, our steps will also keep increasing.

#Finding 17, it's the same for inserting and removing as well. 

```js
{
  value: 51; // First step
  left: {
    value:23; // Second step
        left:{
            value:17; // Third step so 2^3
            left:null;
            right:null;
        };
        right:{
            value:19;
            left:null;
            right:null;
        };
  };
  right: {
    value:65;
        left:{
            value:67;
            left:null;
            right:null;
        };
        right:{
            value:52;
            left:null;
            right:null;
        };
  };
}
```
In binary tree's scenerio, it's best to use O(log n) as it follows divide and conquor method which is extremely efficient when seen from graph as well. As it follows that technique, if we want to find leaf 67 which is child of 65 which is the right child of parent 51, first it check in parent and if falls under right then it'll ignore left side completely and same when enters in child and so on which improves time complexity by a ton. The worse case scenerio for binary tree would be O(n) which happens by chance when a value is found by going straight towards right child and it's right child and so on or vice versa because that makes it similar to Linked List where iteration is done straight from head to tail during pop method for making tail come one pointer to left.  

# Compared to LinkedList, insert is better for Linked List since no O(n) involved while lookup and remove is better in tree as it follows divide and conquer method. Same with array as to lookup, we've to do iteration on it as well.
