Now instead of another loop, let's place second loop inside first loop:

    function log(n) {
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          console.log(i, j);
        }
      }
    }

    log(3);

The output will be like below:

    0 0
    0 1
    0 2
    1 0
    1 1
    1 2
    2 0
    2 1
    2 2

This is called O(n^2) and it's going to dramatically increase number of operation when compared to O(n).
Now if there is another for loop nested in second loop, it can be called O of n cubed or 0(n^3). However, for simplicity sake, we keep it O of n squared or 0(n^2) because they're roughly in same broad category of Big O when compared to O(n!) or O(log n) which are much different. This is different from competitive programming where difference like between O(n^2) and O(n^3) is measured in every operation.
