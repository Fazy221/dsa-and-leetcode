Under the hood, let's pick an item 4 from a linkedlist. This 4 is an object, also called node and contains two properties; value and next. It looks like this:

    {
      value: 4,
      next: null,
    }

Now, for a value which is pointing on left, it's just the parent which is pointing through next and have next node as nested child:

    const LinkedList = {
      value: 7,
      next: {
        value: 4,
        next: null,
      },
    };

So here is how full Linked List would look like:

    {
    head: {
        value: 11,
        next: {
            value: 3,
            next: {
                value: 23,
                next: {
                    value: 7,
                    next: {
                        value: 4,
                        next: null,
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
    };

Couldn't show tail properly in video but it basically have next property with same value as 7's next which is 2nd last item pointing to the last item.
