Let's see JS OOP example:

    class Cookie {
      constructor(color) {
        this.color = color;
      }
      getColor() {
        return this.color;
      }
      setColor(color) {
        this.color = color;
      }
    }

    const cookieOne = new Cookie("green");
    const cookieTwo = new Cookie("blue");
    console.log(cookieOne) // will return cookieOne obj
    console.log(cookieOne.color) // will return cookieOne's property color
    // Using Getter & Setter
    cookieOne.setColor('yellow');
    console.log(cookieOne.getColor());

After making cookie class, we build it's instance cookieOne. The new keyword calls the constructor function and the color value which is passed in it is like blueprint, constructor sees which instance is calling it then by using this.color, it assigns this particular color value to the instance. Then we can use getter and setter methods.
