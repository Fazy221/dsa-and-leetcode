Let's see JS OOP example:

    class Cookie {
      constructor(color) {
        this.color = color;
      }
      getColor() {
        return this.color;
      }
      setColor(color) {
        this.color = color;
      }
    }

    const cookieOne = new Cookie("green");
    const cookieTwo = new Cookie("blue");
    console.log(cookieOne) // will return cookieOne obj
    console.log(cookieOne.color) // will return cookieOne's property color
    // Using Getter & Setter
    cookieOne.setColor('yellow');
    console.log(cookieOne.getColor());

After making cookie class, we build it's instance cookieOne. The new keyword calls the constructor function and the value which is passed in it, constructor sees which instance is calling it then by using this.color, it defines that set the color whatever this particular instance's value "which is color in this case" is asking for. Then we can use getter and setter methods.
