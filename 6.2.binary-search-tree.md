Binary search tree is a specific type of tree in which values are added based on how great or less they're. If an added value is greater than existing value, it's added on right side otherwise it's added on left side. Now a value comes which is again greater than existing value then it'll be checked if it's recently appended child value is greater or lesser than new value and if it's less then it'll be added on left side otherwise right side. It's vice versa for left side

To give an example, imagine we've a value called 42 and we want to append 76 to it as it's child. Since 76 is greater than 42, it'll come on right side. Then we add 57. Since 57 is greater than 42 so it'll come to it's right side and then check if it's greater than 42's right child 72. As no so it'll come on 72's left side otherwise it would've come on right side. In same way, if a added value is less than 42 like 21 then it'll come on 42's left and again value added like 27 which is less than 42 but greater than 21 so it'll come 42's child 21's right side. 

One thing to notice is that it keeps going bigger if we focus on right pointers and keep going less if keep focus on left pointers
