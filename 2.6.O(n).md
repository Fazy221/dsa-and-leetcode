Look at this simple for loop code:

    function log(n) {
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }
    }

    log(10);

When we pass n as 10, it outputs 10 times so that's what O of n is. The number of output is directly proportional to the number we pass in. In other wording, the number of operation is directly proportional to whatever n is.

On the graph, x axis represents n value and y axis represents number of operations.
