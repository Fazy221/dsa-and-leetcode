Now as we're going to build Linked List class, there are other common methods very similar to constructor but with additional functionalities:

    class LinkedList {
      constructor(value) {} // create node
      push(value) {} // create node and add value in end
      unshift(value) {} // create node and add value in start
      insert(index, value) {} // create node and add value wherever index is located
    }

We can see that all methods have one functionality in common which is create node. To reduce dry code, we can make separate class for creating node specifically:

    class Node {
      constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = next;
      }
    }

Now creating node will look like this: const newNode = new Node(4);

Accumulating all of this, will write like this:

    class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
    }

    class LinkedList {
    constructor(value) {
        const newNode = new Node(value);
        this.head = newNode;
        this.tail = this.head;
        this.length = 1;
    }
    }
    let myLinkedList = new LinkedList(4);
    console.log(myLinkedList);

To explain:
When you create a new linked list with let myLinkedList = new LinkedList(4);, the constructor of the LinkedList class is called with the value 4.
Inside the constructor, a new node newNode is created with the value 4.
The head of the linked list (this.head) is set to the newNode, making newNode the first node in the linked list.
Since there is only one node in the linked list at this point, the tail of the linked list (this.tail) is also set to the newNode but through this.head because the only node in the list is both the head and the tail. If there is nothing in list then there is no point of tail hence it's same as head which is null.
Finally, the length of the linked list is set to 1, indicating that there is one node in the linked list.
