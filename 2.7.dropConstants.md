Back to our log function, we'll throw in another loop which performs same loop functionality:

    function log(n) {
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }
      for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        console.log(j);
      }
    }

    log(3);

If we'll log this in console, we'll get the following result:

    0
    1
    2
    0
    1
    2

Therefore, we can confidently say that we ran code n + n times which makes it 0(2n). However, unless we're working for large datasets, it doesn't make a difference whether it's 2n, 50n or 100n. Thus for simplicity sake, we drop/remove the constant and keep it 0(n). At the end of the day, O(n) and O(2n) are same in broad range.
