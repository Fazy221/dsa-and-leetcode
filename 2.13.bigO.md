Let's consider that we've an array:

[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Let's add another value at end using .push() method. The indexing will remain same throughout array and only additional index will be entered along new value:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Inversely, if we use .pop() method then it'll remove the last value which is technically last index and rest of the array's index will have no effect. This is known as O(1) since this is constant because value is being put at the end directly, creating new index without need of iterating throughout array.

[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Now if we do polar opposite and add/remove in start of array using .shift(value) / .unshift() method, the index of rest of the items in array will be affected. Therefore, this is called O(n) because whole array will be iterated and index will be changed for one item which is added in start.
[57,1,2,3,4,5,6]

It's also remain O(n) if we add in middle of array using .splice(value to add on which index, remove what, value) since Big O measures worse case not average case (theta) so it won't be like O(1/2 n).

Now if there is big array of million and you want to go at a specific one like item 4000, search by index to go directly to that in memory with O(1). However, if it involves alot of adding/removing which causes reindexing then we can prefer some other more suitable data structure instead of array.
