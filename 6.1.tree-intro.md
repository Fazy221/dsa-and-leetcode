Trees are pretty similar to LinkedList. In fact, linkedlist itself is a tree.

A tree is a single parent having two childs. It can have more than two but then it won't be called binary tree. It looks like sth like this:

```javascript
{
  value: 51;
  left: null;
  right: null;
}
```

with values to left and right being added, it looks sth like below:

```javascript
{
    value: 51;
    left: {
        value: 92;
        left:null;
        right:null;
    }
    right: {
        value: 49;
        left:null;
        right:null;
    }
}
```

The Binary tree has 3 rules: 1. Full 2. Perfect  3. Complete

#1. If a binary tree is full, it means it's children have either 0 or 2 nodes. Any child tree having single node won't be full

```javascript
{
    value: 51;
    left: {
        value: 92;
        left:null;
        right:null;
    }
    right: {
        value: 49;
        left:42;
        right:null; // right tree being null while left has a value
    }
}
```

#2. Perfect is when every line in binary tree's children holds a value. If there is one child with 2 left/right holding values and second child holding no left/right value then although it's full but not perfect

```javascript
    {
        value: 51;
        left: {
            value: 92;
            left:42; // first child holding value
            right:14; // first child holding value
        }
        right: {
            value: 49;
            left:null; // second child holding no value
            right:null; // second child holding no value
        }
    }
```

#3. Complete will be prolly explored in future but for now, it just states complete whether child has nodes other than 0 and 2 (which mean tree ain't full but still complete) or one child hold values and other don't (which mean tree ain't perfect but still complete)

Now coming to further terminologies, a tree can't start with two parents. It's supposed to be single parent with childs like in below way:

```javascript
{
  value: value;
  left: 42;
  right: 95;
}
```

Furthermore, the values that don't contain childs are called `leafs`
