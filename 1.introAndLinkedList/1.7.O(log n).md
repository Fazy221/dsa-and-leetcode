Let's consider that we've following array:

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

To get 1, we can use divide and conquer technique in which we cut the first half by 2 and keep doing until we get our result:

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

    [1, 2, 3, 4] // 1st step

    [1, 2] // 2nd step

    [1] // 3rd step

So we were able to get 1 by going through 3 steps. Keeping the base as 2 (slicing half), we can use these steps as exponents and say: 2^3 = 8 

Now from mathematical perspective, we can also call it using following logarithm methodology:

    log(sub 2) 8 = 3 [see 1:45 of video].

Diving deep from this pov, we're basically saying that if we've a value 8 and don't know the answer that how many times it's going to be halved or divided by 2 to get to the value 1 then we can use this log formula.

This is super useful when we get a large value like array comprised of 1,073,741,824 which is a billion but using log which follows divide and conquer principle, if we want to get to the last value then we can reach there by dividing only 31 times!
