Linked Lists are first data structure that we'll learn. They're most often compared to arrays. However, there is difference. Array is contiguous [1,2,4,5,7,8] while Linked List is all over the place. Moreover, each item in array has index while linkedlist don't. 

Linked List has 2 variables; Head which points to first item and Tail which points to last item of Linked List.

In Linked List, each item points to it's next item until the last item which point to null; also called null terminated list.
