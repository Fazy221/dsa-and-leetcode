Now we'll introduce another regular loop which will come after the nested loop is executed:

    function log(n) {
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          console.log(i, j);
        }
      }
      for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        console.log(k);
      }
    }

    log(3);

This will log the following results:

    0 0
    0 1
    0 2
    1 0
    1 1
    1 2
    2 0
    2 1
    2 2
    0
    1
    2

Now technically speaking, it'll look something like: O(n^2 + n). Since n^2 is dominant there due to resulting in higher number of operations, we can follow Big O philosophy of simplicity there and remove + n from equation so it again looks back to it's simpler form which is: O(n^2).
