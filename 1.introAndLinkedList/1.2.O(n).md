Look at this simple for loop code:

    function log(n) {
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }
    }

    log(10);

When we pass n as 10, it outputs 10 times so that's what O of n is. It's bcuz as loop starts from 0, it runs once then check if i value is lower than n value which if true, it runs again and keep running until i value is exactly less than n value. Therefore we can say that the number of output is directly proportional to the number we pass in.

On the graph, x axis represents n value and y axis represents number of operations.
