Big O: it's used for measuring efficiency of code and is great for comparison. It measures time and space complexity.

    For example, code 1 might run at 15 sec which is great for time complexity than code 2 which run at full minute

    On other hand, code 2 might consume less memory than code 1 which is great if you value space more depending on scenario

    Time complexity is not how quickly code will run because if it runs on high end pc then it'll run faster. Instead, it's measured with no. of operations it performs
